          I've always been{" "}
          <span className='text-green-500 font-bold'>
            {" "}
            fascinated with building websites
          </span>
          . I started out as a photographer, videographer, and graphic designer,
          and even had my own little company for a year. Then, I jumped into the
          world of web development, learning React and working as a freelancer.
          I've had the pleasure of creating some really cool websites! I'm all
          about{" "}
          <span className='text-green-500 font-bold'>
            patience, problem-solving, and making sure things work just right.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          My go-to tools are{" "}
          <span className='text-green-500 font-bold'>
            React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Prisma
          </span>
          . I've also got some backend skills with{" "}
          <span className='text-green-500 font-bold'>
            Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL
          </span>
          . I'm currently diving into TypeScript, always hungry to learn new
          things. Right now, I'm on the lookout for a full-time gig as a
          Front-End Developer.

          Besides coding, you'll find me gaming ðŸŽ®, strumming on my guitar,
          binge-watching series ðŸ“º, and helping friends fix their computers.
